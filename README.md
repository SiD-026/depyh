## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This repository contains the code and resources for my research project on advancing point cloud reconstruction from two-dimensional (2D) images. The project focuses on integrating depth estimation and comparative analysis to enhance the fidelity of three-dimensional (3D) models generated from point clouds.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Advanced Depth Estimation: Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms to improve the accuracy and granularity of depth information extracted from 2D images.

- Optimized Point Cloud Recreation: Enhancing the process of recreating point clouds from depth-estimated images to faithfully represent the intricate 3D structure of the scene.

- Application in Computer Vision and Augmented Reality: The research has potential applications in fields such as computer vision, augmented reality, and robotics, where accurate 3D spatial understanding is crucial.
